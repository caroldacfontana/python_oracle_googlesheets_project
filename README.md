# python_oracle_googlesheets_project
On this small project, we will be able to access an Oracle database using Python, and retrieve some grants from a user, writing them in a csv file in our pesonal Google Drive (using Googleâ€™s API through gspread lib)

You will find all python codes needed on this repo!

You can get all the instructions for this little project on my personal Git Pages blog >  [Link to my personal blog's article](https://caroldacfontana.github.io/2024-01-26-oracle-python-api/)

Fell free to fork this project if needed!
